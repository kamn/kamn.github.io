I am uncovering betters of creating software.
Through meetings I have come to value:

Not just working software but comprehensive documentation for convincing our customers we can actually do it since it is in writing.

Not just being distracted by change but exponentially adding value through my well-crafted plan that includes envisioneering meetings, synergistic emails, and mainly my opinion. 

Not just on individuals and interaction but bleeding edge process and tools because we partnered with other companies who gave some training and promised us a lot of gains with those.

Not just informal customer collaboration but also formalized collaboration through a contract to empower customers and ensure the best quality, security and onboarding experience.

That is, while things are on the left are good, we seek to shift the paradigm though the things on the right.

P.S. This is a joke.
