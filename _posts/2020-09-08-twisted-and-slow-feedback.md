title: Twisted and Slow Feedback.

To set the scene, I was hired right in the middle of a Netscape-style code rewrite of a major product.
It was a Windows Server application with a legacy C++ Win32 app, a 'old'-style website and the 'new'-style website I was working on.
We were going to complete redo the website and move functionality of the legacy Win32 app into a C# Windows Service.

Of course with rewrites, it is never just a straight port of features.
You need to move the needle!
The functionality was a top priority but so was the UX and also the QA and...everything needed to be top priority,
New features are always appended because it should be 'easier' to add during a rewrite.
To help with all the old features and new there were multiple managers at different ranks.

They also split into Scrum teams.
A person would be part of one major team but could be part of one or two other teams.
You also had Engineering Managers who were above the Scrum team.
There was a QA department of course and also a UX department.
And everyone had a vision.

Let me give you an example of what usually happened.
Product Manager just wants to do X.
There is already some work on it and a story so I continue the work.
Another Manager(from another team) says "You shouldn't be working on X but you should be working on Y".
A meeting is scheduled between Product Manager and Other Manager with me in it.
They argue but I continue on X.

I get into meeting with UX where they hear about X.
I show them X and they say "This needs to be redone."
A meeting is scheduled between Product Manager and UX with me in it.
They argue and I start reworking X.

QA/Support hears about X.
I show them X and they say "No,No,No this isn't right"
A meeting is scheduled between Product Manager and QA/Support with me in it.
They argue and my Product Manager tell me to ignore them.

I am in a meeting with VP of Dev.
Show off X.
"Why are there scrollbars? We need to redo that. In fact I don't like any of this! Lets redo it!"
A meeting is scheduled and we start the entire process again.

Maybe my memory is jaded.
Maybe it wasn't that bad.
The ability for multiple people to give feedback is a good thing.
The above description could be almost be good environment.
Just this entire process could take several slow months and was twisted with politics.
I think that is common but it is not fun for me.

I eventually left because of the professional growth reasons and also because I was tired of the non-progress of the company.
Looking back I would have done the following things
* Say "No" to meetings
* Force mt Product Manager to deal issues without me.
* Work on a faster feedback cycle
* Leave earlier if I didn't see any progress
