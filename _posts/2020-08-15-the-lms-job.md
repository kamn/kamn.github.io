title: The LMS Job

My first programming job was part-time at my university.
The goal was to make a Learning Management System the likes of Blackboard, Canvas, or Moodle.
I worked there part-time for 3 years and I was thrown into the deep-end of the pool. 
Nonetheless it was my most informative and insightful job to date.
In other posts I will write about the negative aspects of working there and stories but I just wanted to point out a few positives

## The Scrumless Agile

I remember asking my boss once about Scrum.
Our development methodology was very unstructured and I wondered why we were not more structured. 
He said, "It doesn't work. You have meeting you don't need, people think it is a promise and it is not dynamic enough."
At the time, I disagreed.
Scrum was Agile and Agile promised to solve all of those issues, I thought.
We should be following a plan instead of responding to "random" change.
Instead of interaction with various people when problems arise we should have processes and tools to help.

After being in more "Agile" Scrum environments and reading the Agile manifesto, I realized it was by far my most agile job.

- You got a task for a specific outcome.
- You were trusted to finish the work as best as you could.
- If there was some deadline, alternatives were offered and requirements were pruned.
- If something more important came up, you wrapped up what you could and switched.
- Every check-in was deployed to a Dev server instantly and to a QA server within a few minutes.
- QA started to check within an hour then stakeholders confirmed within a day

It was the closest to the Agile Manifesto of any job I have been in.

## Continuous Deployment
The LMS was a website so Continuous Deployment was easier than many products but it is still my gold standard for CD.

Many times the following would happen.
- QA reports Bug
- Reproduced in a minute
- 5-minute fix
- Commit
- QA verifies

This would all be within 10 minutes.
At other jobs, to confirmed a bug was fixed there would be a 24-hour wait until the next QA build.
The more continuous the testing, deployment, and delivery the better quality software you produce.

In my mind, I have simplified agile to just having the quickest feedback loops at all levels of an organization.
In a later job, one a build took 24-hours for anyone to even start to validate.
In this job, it took 5 minutes.
Just that one difference alone made development, progress, and satisfaction so much higher. 

## The Best Class

Looking back the biggest surprise of all was how novice every programmer was.
If you were in the second CS class, you could work there.
That is hiring someone with between 4 to 8 months of programming experience total.
On top of that, the LMS was in PHP/Javascript while the Computer Science classes were in Java/C++.
So you had the unholy mixture of little programing experience with a brand new languages and patterns.
I can't believe we got anything done and anyone trusted us to get stuff done.

Even though it was not an official class it was my best learning experience.
The job itself was important but the idea of teaching student workers was an important aspect.
I overheard full-time University workers mention this aspect several times.

It was a forgiving environment and because of that novice programmers could advance quickly.
There were also big issues with the code.
I am sure if I went and looked at my code I would be ashamed.

Without a doubt, it advanced my career by 3 years compared to just studying.

## Conclusion

I painted a fairly upbeat picture but there were issues and 'unfair' circumstances why the software succeeded.
I will do another blog post sometime about that, but I still think about it 

I hope to work in such a weird and wonderful work environment at some point again.
