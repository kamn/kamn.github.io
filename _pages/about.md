I am a developer with 7+ years of experience in web technologies. I graduated in Computer Science from Brigham Young University in 2014. I have worked as a full-stack developer on Learning Management Systems, Network Monitoring, Network Management Systems and Virtual Reality Systems.

I am interested in the "philosophy" of Software Development, Functional Programming, and Programming Languages.
