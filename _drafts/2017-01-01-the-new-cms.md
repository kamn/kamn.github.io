title: The LMS Job
---

My first job was part-time at my university.
The goal was to make a Learning Management System the likes of Blackboard, Canvas or Moodle.
I worked there part-time for 3 years and without a doubt it was my most informative and insightful job.
I hope to write specific programming stories but I just wanted to point out a few things I learned.

## The Agiless Agile

I remember asking my boss once about Agile and Scrum and why we didn't do it.
He said "It doesn't work".
At the time I thought it was stupid.
We should be following a plan instead of responding to "random" change.
Instead of interaction with various people when problems arise we should have process and tools to help.

That is Agile and Scrum! Or least how I thought it was explained to me.

After being in "Agile" environments and actually reading the Agile manifesto, I realized it was by far my most agile job in various ways.

- You got a task from the boss.
- You were trusted to finish the work as best as you could.
- If there was some deadline, alternatives were offered and requirements were pruned.
- If something more important came up, you wrapped up what you could and switched.
- Every check-in was deployed to a Dev server instantly and to a QA server within a few minutes.

It was the closest to the Agile Manifesto of any job I have been in.


## Continuous Deployment
The LMS was a website so Continuous Deployment was easier than may products but it is still my gold standard for CD.

Many times the following would happen.
- QA reports Bug
- Reproduced in a minute
- 5 minute fix
- Commit
- QA verifies

This would all be within 10 minutes.
At other jobs to confirmed a bug was fixed there would be a 24 hour wait until the next QA build is pushed/comes out.
The more continuous the testing, deployment and delivery the better quality software you produce.

## Novice Programmers
Looking back the biggest surprise of all was how novice every programmer was.
If you at least were in a second CS class you could work there.
Think about it.
That is hiring someone someone with between 4 to 8 months of programming experience total.
On top of that the LMS was in PHP while the programming classes were in Java/C++.
- Little experience
- No experience with language

Even thinking back I can't believe we got anything done.

There was one great benefit: you could make mistakes.
It was a forgiving environment and because of that novice programmers could advance quickly.
There were also tons of issues with the code.
I am sure if I went and looked at my code I would be ashamed.

## The Best Class

Even though it was not a official class it was without a doubt my best class.
The job itself was important but the idea of teaching student workers was an important aspect.
At least a few time I overheard full-time University works mention this aspect.

Without a doubt it advanced my career by 3 years compared to just studying.

## The Problems

Without a doubt there were some big problems.
The biggest were always in terms of grades.
There were several very bad bugs.
Sometimes a grade a TA enter would not be saved.
A professional should have been hired for those spots.

## Conclusion

There are things outside of
I hope to work in such a weird and wonderful work environment at some point again.
It had a lot of problems with having such novice programmers but it still succeed in big ways.


Actually very bad problems the biggest
